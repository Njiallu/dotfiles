Installation
------------
Arch Linux users can install from the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/flatplat-theme) maintained by @cthbleachbit.

Fedora and EPEL users can also install from a [Copr repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/tcg/themes/).

### Manual Installation
1. Open the terminal and run the following commands:

  ```sh
  cd /tmp
  curl -sL https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/archive/v20170605.tar.gz | tar xz
  cd Flat-Plat-20170605 && sudo ./install.sh
  ```

2. Select the theme using `gnome-tweak-tool` or other suitable tools.

3. Optionally;
  - Set the font size to `9.75` (= 13px at 96dpi) or `10.5` (= 14px at 96dpi).
  - Open the `chrome` folder on `/usr/share/themes/Flat-Plat`* and drag and drop the `.crx` files onto the Chrome/Chromium _Extensions_ page.

### Manual Uninstallation
- Delete the installed directories.

  ```sh
  sudo rm -rf /usr/share/themes/Flat-Plat{,-compact,-dark,-dark-compact,-light,-light-compact}
  ```

GDM (Lock/Login Screen)
-----------------------
You can change the GDM theme by replacing the default GNOME Shell theme.  
However, if it fails, the desktop environment may not operate correctly. So please **be careful** if doing this.

#### :warning: Cautions:
- When applying this, other third-party GNOME Shell themes would look broken until you restore to the original theme.
- If GNOME Shell has been updated, it will be restored to the original theme, so you will need to install this again.

### Installation
1. Select a GTK+ theme, then run the following commands to back up and replace the existing theme file.

  ```sh
  GTK_THEME=$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme | sed "s/'//g")
  sudo cp -v --backup /usr/share{/themes/$GTK_THEME,}/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource
  ```

  > _Developer note:_  
  > If you don't want to overwrite the backup on the second and subsequent runs, delete the `--backup` option.

2. Restart GNOME Shell. (If you are running _GNOME on Xorg_, press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd> then type `r`.)

### Uninstallation
1. Restore to the original theme from the backup.

  ```sh
  sudo mv -v /usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource{~,}
  ```

2. Restart GNOME Shell. (If you are running _GNOME on Xorg_, press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd> then type `r`.)
